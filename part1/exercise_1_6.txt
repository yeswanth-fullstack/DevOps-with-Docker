After executing the below command,

docker run -it devopsdockeruh/pull_exercise

I have opened dockerhub and searched for org first [ devopsdockerhub ] and then I found pull_exercise image

Inside readme I can see "basics" as the input. I have entered this in docker prompt and then the secret message is revealed as 

"This is the secret message"
