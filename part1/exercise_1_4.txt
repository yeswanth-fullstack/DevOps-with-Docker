Here is the command to start the process,

docker run -it --name dependencies ubuntu sh -c 'while true; do echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website; done'

In other bash, execute below command

docker exec -it dependencies bash

and inside bash, execute below commands

apt-get update
apt-get install curl

then in the first bash re enter the input and the issue is resolved
